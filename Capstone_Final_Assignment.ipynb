There have been loads of studies on what made Starbucks successful, and a lot of experts claim that their key asset is their coffee shops locations.\n\nImagine you own a restaurant or a coffee house in a certain city and you're doingvery well. The idea of opening a second restaurant or coffee house wonders your head but, where should you put it? If you're doing well with the one that you already have, maybe you just want to replicate that in the other side of town. If your current one is not doing well, maybe you should move a different neighbourhood. Data science is a good way to solve this question.\n\nIt's an interesting cas study because it's valid for other situations. If you like your actual neighbourhood but you must move to another city, you can use the same method to determine wich neighbourhood is a good choice for you. This should be done with more than just location information. This analysis will stay just with the Foursquare data for Toronto NewYork and New York (Manhattan)"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data <a name=\"data\"></a>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "For this analysis, the New York Data from the previous labs (taken from https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset) will be used.

Firste, there's the Wikipedia postal codes table(taken from\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M).\n\nIt contains the names, postal code and borough of every neighbourhood in Toronto. In second place, a csv file that has the latitude and longitude for every postal code in Toronto (taken from\nhttps://cocl.us/Geospatial_data)\n\nAnd finally, we used the Foursquare API to get information about the most popular veneus around within a 500 meters radius of every neighbourhood's coordinates.
